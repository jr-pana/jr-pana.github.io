            <p>Hihi ! This is a little website that I'm working on to improve my programming skills. I will occasionally update it here and there, maybe add or remove stuff too. So anything below this line of text is really stuff that is very likely to be changed or moved or deleted. So if there's something here that you'd want to keep or remember, feel free to download, or, "print" / "save as", the website on whatever device you're on! </p>
